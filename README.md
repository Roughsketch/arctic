# Arctic

Rust library for handling Polar bluetooth heart rate monitors.

Currently only targeting support for H10 due to lack of other devices.

### Note for MacOS

Using Btleplug on MacOS will require you to give your terminal (or whatever app you're using) permissions to use Bluetooth. 
View [here](https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug#macos-permissions-note) to see how to resolve this issue.
